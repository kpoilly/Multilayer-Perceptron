# Multilayer Perceptron

**Final note: Not evaluated yet.**


## Description:
   This project focuses on implementing a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch for binary classification of breast cancer diagnosis.
   Learning core concepts like backpropagation and gradient descent, evaluating model performance using binary cross-entropy, and exploring advanced optimization techniques like Adam optimizer and more.

   More informations about dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.names).

## Programs:
### - separate.py :
   Separates the given data in 2 part, training set and validation set.
        
   Args: 
   
         `--train_size`, size of the training set (% of the dataset).

### - train.py :
   Trains the model on the previously separated data, using the training set for training, and the validation set for validation / early-stopping.

   Args: 
   
         `--layers`, Number of hidden layers between input and output layer
         `--layersW`, Number of neurons per layer
         `--epochs`, Number of epochs
         `--lr`, Learning rate
         `--batch_size`, Batch size
         `--patience`, Number of epochs without improvement tolerated (early stopping)
         `--clear`, Delete every models saved and their data visuals
         `--optimize`, Enable Adam optimizer
        
   Example: 
    ```
        python3 train.py --epochs 500 --batch_size 32 --patience 2 --lr 0.00125 --optimize
    ```

### - predict.py :
   Calculates the accuracy and the Binary Entropy Loss of a given model number, or compares every models saved in a graph.
    
   Args:
   
         `--compare`, activate the comparison mode, comparing every models saved in models/ and show their accuracy and loss in a single graph.

### - test.py:
   Takes 1 line of data as a command-line argument and uses a previously trained model to give the percentage chance of each of the two possible diagnoses.

   Argv: 1 line of the 30 data, just like in the dataset (without the 2 first elements).
